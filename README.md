# Solfate Labs

Solfate Labs is a public experiment into building developer tooling and resources for the Solana ecosystem.

## Why Solfate?

Building in the Solana ecosystem is often referred to as "chewing glass".

The chemical compound _sodium sulfate_ is used to make and refine raw materials into glass.

Enter Solfate, the Solana themed pun on sulfate. Solana Solfate will be used to refine Solana glass.
